function [] = gravity_compensation()
% gravity_compensation
%
%   This function makes the robot "weightless", extering joint torques that
%   counteract the effect of gravity on the system.
%
%   This function connects to a robot and records the feedback data while
%   executing setting appropriate joint torques.
%
%   Note that this should reuse function(s) written in ex_02.
%
%   Make sure that the corresponding robot is plugged in.
%
%   Example:
%      gravity_compensation();
%

%% Define variables for gravity:
gravity = [0; -9.81]; % [m/s^2]
